    "## Goal of this Notebook:\n",
    "In this notebook I wanted to work on the Kaggle's Titanic Dataset and predict the survial of the passenger. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to follow the standard Machine Learning project workflow :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the problem and Looking at the big picture.\n",
    "2. Get the data.\n",
    "3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights\n",
    "4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms\n",
    "5. Select a model and train it.\n",
    "6. Fine-tune the solution.\n",
    "7. Present the solution\n",

    "### Problem Description :\n",
    "\n",
    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",

    "2. We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Correcting__\n",
    "1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n",
    "2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n",
    "3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n",
    "4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Creating__\n",
    "1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n",
    "2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n",
    "3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.\n",
    "4. We may also want to create a Fare range feature if it helps our analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Women (Sex=female) were more likely to have survived.\n",
    "2. Children (Age<?) were more likely to have survived.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. __Pclass__ We observe significant correlation (>0.5) among Pclass=1 and Survived (classifying #3). We decide to include this feature in our model.\n",
    "2. __Sex__ We confirm the observation during problem definition that Sex=female had very high survival rate at 74% (classifying #1).\n",
    "3. __SibSp and Parch__  These features have zero correlation for certain values. It may be best to derive a feature or a set of features from these individual features (creating #1).\n"
