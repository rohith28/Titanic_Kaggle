## Titanic-kaggle

The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat. I have been playing with the Titanic dataset for a while, and exploring different ways to predict using Machine Learning algorithms.

### Problem Description
> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

> In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

### Installation

1. Install Anaconda from official [website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
2. Activate the environment, by following these [instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
3. Intsall Scikit Learn, which is a machine learning library for python. Instrucations can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
4. Install required dependencies in requirements.txt
5. Check the Notebook is working or not by opening jupyter notebook.

### Dependencies 

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)

### Goal for this Notebook

In this Notebook, I want to practise Data Handling, Data Analysis, Data wrangling, Data Visualization and Create Machine Learning model.

### Data Handling, Analysis and Visualization 
* Importing Data with Pandas
* Cleaning Data
* Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

### Data Wrangling 
* Dropping features which are not 
* Creating new features by combining features

### Machine Learning Model
There are lot of predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is classification and regression.

So our problem is Supervised Learning plus Classificaiton and regression.

Choice of our models can be :

* Logistic Regression
* KNN or k-Nearest neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Navie- Bayes Classifier
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Preception
* Artificial Neural Networks
* RVM or Relevance Vector Machine

### Valuation 
 Valuating the all the models and testing the models with test set. And tuning the parameters to acheive best result.
